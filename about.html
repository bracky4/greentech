    <div id="p2">Green House technology is very useful technique used to achieve significant improvements in the field of agriculture to get high quality yield, by efficient utilization of water with better cultivation methods.<br><br> 
Providing controlled environment condition to ensure the quality and productivity of the plant growth, depending on temperature, humidity, light and soil moisture and other environmental conditions is very important in Green Houses.<br><br> 
Monitoring this valuable information not only helps the framer but also plays an important role in automation. In Today’s busy life it is very difficult for the farmer to keep track about the progress in his farm, it is tedious to take decisions due to unpredictable weather conditions.<br> <br>
To overcome these problems one can, take help of technology which is smart enough to take the decisions based on environmental conditions and notify the farmer about the developments in his farm. It is excellent to have a system which communicates through WEB app and could be easily controllable, which makes a need for emergence of “Self-Regulating Platform for Green House Farmers”.<br> <br>
